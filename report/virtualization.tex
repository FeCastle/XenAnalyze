\subsection{Profiling}
Profiling allows a user or system administrator to see which functions are being called the most frequently or consume the most time.  Oprofile \cite{levon} is a profiler that can profile both application and kernel functions, by registering with the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) on the CPU.  The PMU will track hardware counters and will notify the registered profiler when a specific hardware counter reaches a threshold set by the profiler \cite{mucci}.  When Oprofile receives notification, through an NMI, it will record the PC and other information about the system, and over time will have the most frequently called function when the specified hardware event occurred.  Some typical hardware event counters are:  TLB miss, LLC cache miss, or CPU instructions retired.   Other profilers like OSprof use latency distribution analysis [7].  As function calls are entered and exited to or from the stack, the profiler tracks the start and end time of the functions.

Research at VMware \cite{serebrin} shows the importance and challenges of implementing hardware counters on the PMU for analyzing interference from a virtual guest perspective.
The difficulties with running a profiler like Oprofile in a virtualized guest is that the hardware counters in the guest may not be available for all hypervisors \cite{buell1}.  Additionally, the guest is not guaranteed to receive interrupts in a correct order.   Tracking the wall-clock time and CPU time on virtual machines is extremely difficult and there are many additions in the hypervisor to help guest machines accurately track time.  On many systems, kernel level profiling is not enabled. A patch or configuration change is needed to enable profiling, which makes it difficult on production systems.
In the Xen environment, Xenoprof allows the virtual guest to read hardware performance counters from the guest OS perspective \cite{menon, du2}.  However, Xenoprof does not analyze the results or draw any conclusions about the counters.  

\indent In virtualization there are 2 types of profiling:  Guest-wide profilers only profile a single guest (or domain), and System-wide which monitors all guests and the VMM \cite{du1}.  In order to provide Guest-wide profiling for virtual systems, the profiler runs in the guest and the VMM needs to provide synchronous delivery of interrupts from the hardware to the guest machines.  For System-wide profiling the profiler runs in the VMM and requires interaction between the guest OS and VMM.  Specifically, the VMM needs to know which application and kernel functions are running on the guest machine at the time of the interrupt.

\indent Xenoprof uses Oprofile to provide the profiling and uses Xen's hypercalls to share information between the guest and Xen Hypervisor.  The Xenoprof toolkit supports system-wide coordinated profiling in a Xen environment.  The underlying Oprofile uses statistical profiling across domains and can track functions running in the user space, kernel space, and in the hypervisor.  Xenoprof provides a performance event interface which maps physical hardware events to virtual HW counters \cite{santos, menon2}.   The guest-level profiling registers with the virtual CPU, and the hypervisor registers with the physical hardware.  Since it is not possible to call the domain level virtual interrupt handler synchronously, Xenoprof collects the samples for the guest domain and logs them to that specific domain buffer, and then Xenoprof sends a virtual interrupt to the guest domain.

\indent In KVM, a Linux Kernel VM subsystem, a customized profiler can implement both guest-wide and system-wide profiling \cite{du2}.  Linux perf is another profiler that runs in the Host Linux on KVM, and can measure software and hardware event counters as well as tracing.  It is aware of the memory layout of the guest and can monitor the Kernel space of the guest VM, but not its user-space application. 

\begin{comment}
\indent VMware ESX sever strives to provide a complete full virtualization including hardware counters to allow any guest profiling to work as if it were on native hardware.  VMware creates a virtual timer for the guest OS, but the profiler may need relative time difference and track only time on the Virtual CPU.  Additionally, there needs to be a way to efficiently and accurately emulate interrupt events from the virtual machine to the host. These techniques are classified as speculative and non-speculative events, and the Hypervisor may try to give the guest a complete view of system in order to run any Profiler in the unmodified guest OS.  VMware provides VMKperf in order to profile the hypervisor, but does not profile the guest OS.
\end{comment}

\indent Profiling results also require manual inspection and may not show how interference from external layers impact the guest machine \cite{traeger, knapp1}.  Additionally, the user running the profiler needs to have some "guess" or prior knowledge about what event to sample, and the desired frequency of the sample.  Should the user sample cache miss, TLB miss, or some other counter?  As more events are profiled, the more perturbation is encountered.  In a virtual environment a user may need to start several profilers on several virtual machines each monitoring various hardware counters, system state, and applications.  Only after several runs in many different configurations and manual inspection could an advanced administrator make some determination as to the root cause of the problem. 

\subsection{Performance Monitoring}
Modern operating systems have a method of monitoring the current performance of the system.  User tools use statistics tracked in the kernel to monitor access to resources, and are not (necessarily) related to the PMU on the CPU.  For example a specific CPU may track hardware events such as L2 cache miss, or TLB cache miss, but the kernel will track time spent reading or writing to a physical disk, or virtual memory cache information.  User tools aggregate and relate these statistics to provide the user some inference about the system.

\indent In a Linux OS there are administration tools such as top, iostat, ps, and vmstat.  
Windows uses \emph{Performance Monitor} or \emph{Resource Monitor} to show the current performance.  
Most kernels will write statistics when each resource is used, and these tools read and analyze the kernel data about resource usage, through the method provided by the kernel.
By examining these counters and aggregating the data with tools, an administrator can see the current threads and how each of the resources are being used. 

\indent When a system is virtualized, the guest OS kernel only tracks the statistics from its own viewpoint.  
In other words, the resource statistics are for the virtualized resource, and not the physical resource.   
The counters do not collect information from external guests or show the interference from external guests or the hypervisor.  
The host system kernel will track all the guests, but is unable to identify which process in the guest may be degraded.
In order to accurately analyze performance issues on complex virtualized systems, we need to collect and analyze resource usage from all systems and the hypervisor.  
We need the ability to perform System-wide performance monitoring similar to the System-wide profiling available.

\subsubsection{Linux Tools}
\indent On Linux the kernel resource counters are tracked in the /proc file system, which is a dynamic view into the kernel data structures and statistics \cite{proc}.  
For example \emph{/proc/stat} contains statistics about the time (since boot) that the the CPU was idle, running in user mode, or running in kernel mode.
By running a test load and examining the /proc file system, one can reasonably determine the resources used and which process or thread is using them.  
Without virtualization, these tools can quickly narrow the scope of possible problems for a degraded system.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Windows Tools}
On Windows OS the counters are similar and are tracked by the Windows kernel about processes and threads.  The user space API \cite{winperf} is used by the user application to display graph or report. The GUI administration tool can display any number of statistics about the system.  Similar to the /proc file system in Linux there is little or no information provided about the overhead and interference from external layers.

\subsubsection{Hypervisor Tools}
Similar tools have been created in the hypervisor, \emph{xentop} for Xen and \emph{esxtop} for VMware, to show each virtual machine running and the resources that the entire machine is using.  
These tools use the same information from the \emph{proc} file system as VMware and Xen use a Linux based kernel.  
From this view we can see the guest machines, and the hypervisor, but we can't easily determine how they impact each other.  There is also no way to relate a virtual process running in the guest machine from the hypervisor tools.  The hypervisor has no access to the guest information.
Even if the these could show everything running in the guest machines, the administrator for the hypervisor and guest machines are different people or even completely different organizations.

\subsubsection{Steal Time - Complete View}
Due to the fact that the hypervisor has one view of the system, and the virtualized guests have a different view of the system, the Xen Hypervisor has added a \emph{steal time} statistic and made it available to the guest operating systems.  New Linux distributions have implemented this new kernel option as \emph{steal: involuntary wait} \cite{proc}.  Additionally, administrative tools top, sar, and vmstat have all implemented this new counter.  
On most systems top will show as '0.0\%st' (Figure ~\ref{fig:top}), but if it is running on a Xen Hypervisor the paravirtualized guest will communicate with the hypervisor and collect information. Amazon cloud uses Xen and this has become a valuable tool for guests to determine if they are having performance problems from external interference \cite{netflix}.
 We did not know about the CPU \emph{steal time} when we started this work, but it has shown to be a valuable metric for applications running in the cloud. 
Our work is different from this in that \emph{steal time} is a specific implementation for the CPU resource on a Xen hypervisor with a Linux Guest.  Our method is a general approach that can be used on other platforms.  More importantly, I/O and not CPU time is the focus of our approach.

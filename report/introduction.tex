Virtualization is a way to emulate hardware in order to allow multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a physical system.  The hypervisor provides an abstraction and isolation of each guest to ensure protection. Virtualization allows data centers to reduce cost and power by overcommitting and sharing system resources across disparate operating systems with common hardware  (Figure \ref{virtStack}).

In a single server environment or HPC cluster there can be \emph{interference} \cite{paul} or \emph{system noise}\cite{tsafrir} caused by complex software layers (Application, OS, and Hardware), that causes poor application performance.  
The hypervisor, as well as multiple external guest virtual machines, compete for system resources and add to this interference.  Current performance tools in the virtual guests are unable to distinguish between performance problems in the guest machine and external interference.  We have developed a method to aggregate resource counters from multiple layers of virtualization to accurately diagnose interference as the root cause of a performance bottleneck.

\subsection{Measurement Challenges}
On a physical server, we can assume the hardware speed is known.  For a CPU we can measure in hertz or floating point operations per second (FLOPS), and for a disk we can measure in I/O per second (IOPS) or latency.  When that system is virtualized, the availability of the virtual resources are dynamic.  The resource may (or may not) be available to the guest and the performance tools become nearly meaningless.  Without knowledge of the availability, it is difficult to diagnose or find a root cause from a guest application. There is almost no way to distinguish between a poor running application, OS kernel issue, or external interference.  From the Hypervisor view, there is no information about the guest applications or guest kernel functions, so there is no way to relate a problem to a guest application.  Furthermore, the entity managing the hypervisor layer is likely a completely different organization than the entity managing the virtual guest. 

Since each guest machine only uses a portion of the available resources at any given time, the total resources allocated to all guest VMs can exceed the total physical resources \cite{huber2, amit, buell1}.   This idea of overcommitting resources is the same as preemptive multitasking, where multiple processes share a single CPU; and OS virtual memory, where the total memory available to applications exceeds the physical memory capacity.  In order to maximize resources, IT data centers overcommit the resources, with the hope that multiple virtual guest machines do not need all resources concurrently.  Even when the CPU and memory are not overcommitted there is still shared cache and memory bus.  For network and disk I/O multiple guests usually share access to a single physical resource, which can cause interference when accessed concurrently.

Existing performance tools fall into three categories, but they are unable to accurately diagnose or find a root cause of performance problems of production guest systems.  First, profiling tools are available on limited platforms, and require significant guest kernel and hypervisor support and coordination.  Additionally, profiling is a great tool for identifying problems in test and development, but may not be available on production systems.  
Second, performance monitoring tools are readily available on most every operating system.  They are very valuable for physical hardware but they assume that the resources are constant.  The performance data used by the tools when external systems are causing interference is indistinguishable from a change in the application workload.
Finally, hypervisor tools can show each guest and the physical resources, but they do not have access to the applications in the guest.  There is no way to relate a problem seen in the hypervisor to specific processes in the guest or the guest kernel.

\subsection{The growing importance of virtualization}
Due to the cost savings and decreased physical administration overhead, data centers and businesses are changing from physical server to virtualized environments. In 2008 Gartners research found that virtualization is not just for server consolidation, but for ”efficient use of shared resources” \cite{gartners}.  They attribute the growth of cloud computing to standardization of technologies, increase use of the Internet, and virtualization.  Research from Ramya and Edwin show tremendous growth in Platform As A Service (PAAS) where an entire system platform is dynamically provisioned in a cloud computing service \cite{ramya}. The NIST explicitly states that for PAAS the consumer does not manage or control the underlying infrastructure including networks, servers, and storage. They state that cloud systems should provide a \emph{measured service} and resources utilization is ”monitored, controlled, and reported” by providing transparency of the service \cite{nist}.  Massive data centers are able to provide virtual systems, and manage large clusters of shared resources, for a fraction of the price of building a physical server for each customer.

\subsection{Contributions}
This research presents a method for analyzing performance data at runtime in the guests and Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).   With this framework we can detect the I/O interference by sharing physical and virtual I/O performance statistics between multiple guests.  We believe that this method can be extended to find interference from other resources.  This could significantly reduce time spent troubleshooting and analyzing performance problems in virtualized environments.
